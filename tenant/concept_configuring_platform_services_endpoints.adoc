Before you can configure a platform service for a bucket, you must configure at least one endpoint to be the destination for the platform service.

Access to platform services is enabled on a per-tenant basis by a StorageGRID administrator. To create or use a platform services endpoint, you must be a tenant user with Manage Endpoints or Root Access permission, in a grid whose networking has been configured to allow Storage Nodes to access external endpoint resources. Contact your StorageGRID administrator for more information.

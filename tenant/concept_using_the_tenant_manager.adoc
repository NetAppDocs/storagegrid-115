The Tenant Manager allows you to manage all aspects of a StorageGRID tenant account.

You can use the Tenant Manager to monitor a tenant account's storage usage and to manage users with identity federation or by creating local groups and users. For S3 tenant accounts, you can also manage S3 keys, manage S3 buckets, and configure platform services.

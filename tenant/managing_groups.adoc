You assign permissions to user groups to control which tasks tenant users can perform. You can import federated groups from an identity source, such as Active Directory or OpenLDAP, or you can create local groups.

IMPORTANT: If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for your StorageGRID system, local users will not be able to sign in to the Tenant Manager, although they can access S3 and Swift resources, based on group permissions.

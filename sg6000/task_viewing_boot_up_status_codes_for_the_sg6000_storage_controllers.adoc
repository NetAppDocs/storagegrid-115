[.lead]
Each storage controller has a seven-segment display that provides status codes as the controller powers up. The status codes are the same for both the E2800 controller and the EF570 controller.

For descriptions of these codes, see the E-Series system monitoring information for you storage controller type.

. During boot-up, monitor progress by viewing the codes shown on the seven-segment display for each storage controller.
+
The seven-segment display on each storage controller shows the repeating sequence *OS, Sd, blank* to indicate that the controller is performing start-of-day processing.

. After the controllers have booted up, confirm that each storage controller shows 99, which is the default ID for an E-Series controller shelf.
+
Make sure this value is displayed on both storage controllers, as shown in this example E2800 controller.

. If one or both controllers show other values, see the information about troubleshooting the hardware installation, and confirm you completed the installation steps correctly. If you are unable to resolve the problem, contact technical support.

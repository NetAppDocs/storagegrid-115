The StorageGRID Appliance Installer might not be available if hardware faults or cabling errors prevent the storage controllers or the SG6000-CN controller from completing their boot-up processing.

.Steps

. For the storage controllers, watch the codes on the seven-segment displays.
+
While the hardware is initializing during power up, the two seven-segment displays show a sequence of codes. When the hardware boots successfully, both seven-segment displays show `99`.

. Review the LEDs on the SG6000-CN controller and the boot-up and error codes displayed in the BMC.
. If you need help resolving an issue, contact technical support.

The procedure used to configure an audit client depends on the authentication method: Windows Workgroup or Windows Active Directory (AD). When added, the audit share is automatically enabled as a read-only share.

NOTE: Audit export through CIFS/Samba has been deprecated and will be removed in a future StorageGRID release.

When you want to control access through firewalls, you open or close specific ports at the external firewall.

== Controlling access at the external firewall

You can control access to the user interfaces and APIs on StorageGRID Admin Nodes by opening or closing specific ports at the external firewall. For example, you might want to prevent tenants from being able to connect to the Grid Manager at the firewall, in addition to using other methods to control system access.

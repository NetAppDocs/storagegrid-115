StorageGRID is a fault-tolerant, distributed storage system that is designed to continue operating even when errors occur, or when nodes or sites are unavailable. You must proactively monitor system health, workloads, and usage statistics so that you can take action to address potential issues before they affect the grid's efficiency or availability.

To display a different time interval, select one of the controls above the chart or graph. You can display the information available for intervals of 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. You can also set a custom interval, which allows you to specify date and time ranges.

To see details for CPU utilization and memory usage, hover your cursor over each graph.

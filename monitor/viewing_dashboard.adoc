When you first sign in to the Grid Manager, you can use the Dashboard to monitor system activities at a glance. The Dashboard includes information about system health, usage metrics, and operational trends and charts.

== Health panel

|===
| Description| View additional details| Learn more
a|
Summarizes the system's health. A green checkmark means that there are no current alerts and all grid nodes are connected. Any other icon means that there is at least one current alert or disconnected node.

a|
You might see one or more of the following links:

* *Grid details*: Appears if any nodes are disconnected (connection state Unknown or Administratively Down). Click the link, or click the blue or gray icon to determine which node or nodes are affected.
* *Current alerts*: Appears if any alerts are currently active. Click the link, or click *Critical*, *Major*, or *Minor* to see the details on the *Alerts* > *Current* page.
* *Recently resolved alerts*: Appears if any alerts triggered in the past week are now resolved. Click the link to see the details on the *Alerts* > *Resolved* page.
* *Legacy alarms*: Appears if any alarms (legacy system) are currently active. Click the link to see the details on the *Support* > *Alarms (Legacy)* > *Current Alarms* page.
* *License*: Appears if there is an issue with the software license for this StorageGRID system. Click the link to see the details on the *Maintenance* > *System* > *License* page.

== Available Storage panel

|===
| Description| View additional details| Learn more
a|
Displays the available and used storage capacity in the entire grid, not including archival media.

The Overall chart presents grid-wide totals. If this is a multi-site grid, additional charts appear for each data center site.

You can use this information to compare the used storage with the available storage. If you have a multi-site grid, you can determine which site is consuming more storage.

a|

* To view the capacity, place your cursor over the chart's available and used capacity sections.
* To view capacity trends over a date range, click the chart icon image:../media/icon_chart_new.gif[Chart Icon] for the overall grid, or for a data center site.
* To see details, select *Nodes*. Then, view the Storage tab for the entire grid, an entire site, or a single Storage Node.

== Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) panel

|===
| Description| View additional details| Learn more
a|
Displays current ILM operations and ILM queues for your system. You can use this information to monitor your system's workload.

* *Awaiting - Client*: The total number of objects awaiting ILM evaluation from client operations (for example, ingest).
* *Awaiting - Evaluation Rate*: The current rate at which objects are evaluated against the ILM policy in the grid.
* *Scan Period - Estimated*: The estimated time to complete a full ILM scan of all objects.

  \r\n+\r\n*Note:* A full scan does not guarantee that ILM has been applied to all objects.

a|

* To see details, select *Nodes*. Then, view the ILM tab for the entire grid, an entire site, or a single Storage Node.
* To see the existing ILM rules, select *ILM* > *Rules*.
* To see the existing ILM policies, select *ILM* > *Policies*.

== Protocol Operations panel

|===
| Description| View additional details| Learn more
a|
Displays the number of protocol-specific operations (S3 and Swift) performed by your system.

You can use this information to monitor your system's workloads and efficiencies. Protocol rates are averaged over the last two minutes.

a|

* To see details, select *Nodes*. Then, view the Objects tab for the entire grid, an entire site, or a single Storage Node.
* To view trends over a date range, click the chart icon image:../media/icon_chart_new.gif[Chart Icon] to the right of the S3 or Swift protocol rate.

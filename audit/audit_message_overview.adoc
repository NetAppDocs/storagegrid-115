This guide contains information about the structure and content of StorageGRID audit messages and audit logs. You can use this information to read and analyze the audit trail of system activity.

The guide is for administrators responsible for producing reports of system activity and usage that require analysis of the StorageGRID system's audit messages.

You are assumed to have a sound understanding of the nature of audited activities within the StorageGRID system. To use the text log file, you must have access to the configured audit share on the Admin Node.

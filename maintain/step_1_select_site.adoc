To determine if a site can be decommissioned, start by accessing the Decommission Site wizard.

.What you'll need

* You must have obtained all required materials.
* You must have reviewed the considerations for removing a site.
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.
* You must have the Root Access permission, or the Maintenance and ILM permissions.

.Steps

. Select *Maintenance* > *Maintenance Tasks* > *Decommission*.
+
The Decommission page appears.

. Select the *Decommission Site* button.
+
Step 1 (Select Site) of the Decommission Site wizard appears. This step includes an alphabetic list of the sites in your StorageGRID system.
+

. View the values in the *Used Storage Capacity* column to determine how much storage is currently being used for object data at each site.
+
The Used Storage Capacity is an estimate. If nodes are offline, the Used Storage Capacity is the last known value for the site.

 ** For a connected site decommission, this value represents how much object data will need to be moved to other sites or deleted by ILM before you can safely decommission this site.
 ** For a disconnected site decommission, this value represents how much of your system's data storage will become inaccessible when you decommission this site.
+
NOTE: If your ILM policy was designed to protect against the loss of a single site, copies of your object data should still exist on the remaining sites.

. Review the reasons in the *Decommission Possible* column to determine which sites can be decommissioned currently.
+
NOTE: If there is more than one reason a site cannot be decommissioned, the most critical reason is shown.

You can decommission this site.

Go to step <<SELECT_SITE,#SELECT_SITE>>.
a|
No. This site contains the primary Admin Node.
a|
You cannot decommission a site containing the primary Admin Node.
a|
None. You cannot perform this procedure.
a|
No. This site contains one or more Archive Nodes.
a|
You cannot decommission a site containing an Archive Node.
a|
None. You cannot perform this procedure.
a|
No. All nodes at this site are disconnected. Contact your NetApp account representative.
a|
You cannot perform a connected site decommission unless every node in the site is connected (image:../media/icon_alert_green_checkmark.png[Icon Alert Green Checkmark]).
a|
If you want to perform a disconnected site decommission, you must contact your NetApp account representative, who will review your requirements and enable the rest of the Decommission Site wizard.    *Attention:* Never take online nodes offline so that you can remove a site. You will lose data.

|===
The example shows a StorageGRID system with three sites. The green checkmark (image:../media/icon_alert_green_checkmark.png[Icon Alert Green Checkmark]) for the Raleigh and Sunnyvale sites indicates that you can decommission those sites. However, you cannot decommission the Vancouver site because it contains the primary Admin Node.

. If decommission is possible, select the radio button for the site.
+
The *Next* button is enabled.

. Select *Next*.

Depending on the specific actions you took to get the StorageGRID nodes running on the replacement host, you might need to perform additional recovery steps for each node.

Node recovery is complete if you did not need to take any corrective actions while you replaced the Linux host or restored the failed grid node to the new host.

== Corrective actions and next steps

During node replacement, you may have needed to take one of these corrective actions:

* You had to use the `--force` flag to import the node.
* For any `<PURPOSE>`, the value of the `BLOCK_DEVICE_<PURPOSE>` configuration file variable refers to a block device that does not contain the same data it did before the host failure.
* You issued `storagegrid node force-recovery _node-name_` for the node.
* You added a new block device.

If you took *any* of these corrective actions, you must perform additional recovery steps.

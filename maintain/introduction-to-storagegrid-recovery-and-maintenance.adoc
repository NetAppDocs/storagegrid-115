The recovery and maintenance procedures for StorageGRID include applying a software hotfix, recovering grid nodes, recovering a failed site, decommissioning grid nodes or an entire site, performing network maintenance, performing host-level and middleware maintenance procedures, and performing grid node procedures.

All recovery and maintenance activities require a broad understanding of the StorageGRID system. You should review your StorageGRID system's topology to ensure that you understand the grid configuration.

You must follow all instructions exactly and heed all warnings.

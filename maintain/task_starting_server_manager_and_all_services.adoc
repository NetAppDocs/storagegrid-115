You might need to start Server Manager, which also starts all services on the grid node.

You must have the Passwords.txt file.

Starting Server Manager on a grid node where it is already running results in a restart of Server Manager and all services on the grid node.

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@grid_node_IP`
 .. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Start Server Manager: `service servermanager start`
. Log out of the command shell: `exit`

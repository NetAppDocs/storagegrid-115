If you need to stop a service immediately, you can use the force-stop command.

You must have the Passwords.txt file.

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@grid_node_IP`
 .. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the Passwords.txt file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Manually force the service to terminate: `service servicename force-stop`
+
For example:
+
----
service ldr force-stop
----
+
The system waits 30 seconds before terminating the service.

. Log out of the command shell: `exit`

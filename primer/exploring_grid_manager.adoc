[.lead]
The Grid Manager is the browser-based graphical interface that allows you to configure, manage, and monitor your StorageGRID system.

When you sign in to the Grid Manager, you are connecting to an Admin Node. Each StorageGRID system includes one primary Admin Node and any number of non-primary Admin Nodes. You can connect to any Admin Node, and each Admin Node displays a similar view of the StorageGRID system.

You can access the Grid Manager using a supported web browser.

== Grid Manager Dashboard

[.lead]
When you first sign in to the Grid Manager, you can use the Dashboard to monitor system activities at a glance.

The Dashboard includes summary information about system health, storage use, ILM processes, and S3 and Swift operations.

== Nodes page

[.lead]
The Nodes page displays information about the entire grid, each site in the grid, and each node at a site.

The Nodes home page displays combined metrics for the entire grid. To view information for a particular site or node, click the appropriate link on the left.

== Tenant Accounts page

[.lead]
The Tenant Accounts page allows you to create and monitor the storage tenant accounts for your StorageGRID system. You must create at least one tenant account to specify who can store and retrieve objects and which functionality is available to them.

The Tenant Accounts page also provides usage details for each tenant, including the amount of storage used and the number of objects. If you set a quota when you created the tenant, you can see how much of that quota has been used.

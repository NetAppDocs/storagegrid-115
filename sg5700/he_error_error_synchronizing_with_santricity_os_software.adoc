[.lead]
The seven-segment display on the compute controller shows an HE error code if the StorageGRID Appliance Installer cannot synchronize with SANtricity OS Software.

If an HE error code is displayed, perform this corrective action.

. Check the two interconnect cables between the two controllers, and confirm that the cables and SFP+ transceivers are securely connected.
. As required, replace one or both of the cables or SFP+ transceivers, and try again.
. If this does not resolve the issue, contact technical support.

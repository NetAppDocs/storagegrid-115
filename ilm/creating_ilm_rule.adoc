ILM rules allow you to manage the placement of object data over time. To create an ILM rule, you use the Create ILM Rule wizard.

* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.
* You must have specific access permissions.
* If you want to specify which tenant accounts this rule applies to, you must have the Tenant Accounts permission or you must know the account ID for each account.
* If you want the rule to filter objects on last access time metadata, Last Access Time updates must be enabled by bucket for S3 or by container for Swift.
* If you are creating replicated copies, you must have configured any storage pools or Cloud Storage Pools you plan to use.
* If you are creating erasure-coded copies, you must have configured an Erasure Coding profile.
* You must be familiar with the data-protection options for ingest.

* If you need to create a compliant rule for use with S3 Object Lock, you must be familiar with the requirements.

[NOTE]
====
To create the default ILM rule for a policy, use this procedure instead:

When creating ILM rules:

* Consider the StorageGRID system's topology and storage configurations.
* Consider what types of object copies you want to make (replicated or erasure coded) and the number of copies of each object that are required.
* Determine what types of object metadata are used in the applications that connect to the StorageGRID system. ILM rules filter objects based on their metadata.
* Consider where you want object copies to be placed over time.
* Decide which option to use for data protection option at ingest (Balanced, Strict, or Dual commit)

. Select *ILM* > *Rules*.

The ILM Rules page appears, with the stock rule, Make 2 Copies, selected.

NOTE: The ILM Rules page looks slightly different if the global S3 Object Lock setting has been enabled for the StorageGRID system. The summary table includes a *Compliant* column, and the details for the selected rule include a *Compliant* field.

. Select *Create*.

Step 1 (Define Basics) of the Create ILM Rule wizard appears. You use the Define basics page to define which objects the rule applies to.

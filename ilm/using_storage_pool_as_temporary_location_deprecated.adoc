[.lead]
When you create an ILM rule with an object placement that includes a single storage pool, you are prompted to specify a second storage pool to use as a temporary location.

Temporary locations have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. You should not select a storage pool as a temporary location for a new ILM rule.

NOTE: If you select the Strict ingest behavior (Step 3 of the Create ILM Rule wizard), the temporary location is ignored.
